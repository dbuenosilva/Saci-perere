The challenge of the game is saving the Amazon with Saci-pererê going through the rainforest teasing and annoying its destroyers. To be successful and win the game, you have to arrive with at least seventy points at the Meeting of the Waters, where Negro River meets the Solimões River [2].
After years and years of aboriginals and environmentalist fighting against destroying the Amazon, it is said that Saci-pererê is the unique guy who can put the destroyers away from Amazon. Well-known destroyers of Amazon rainforest are miner companies, wood-sellers, cattle farmers and drug dealers. Saci-pererê bothers the destroyers using his powerful abilities to provoking a dust devil, the "Saci-pererê willy-willy" superpower. If rainforest destroyers come up, you must use "Saci-pererê willy-willy" to tease and to annoy they. For each destroyer annoyed, you get ten extra points.
However, walking around the Amazon rainforest is a bit dangerous. You have to jump threatening animals. So, you must jump to avoid being eaten by a "Sucuri" snake, "Onça-pintada" jaguar, alligator and fish ( Yep, Amazon Piranhas are small fish, but they can eat you quicker than a shark!). To each animal that you jump you get one point. Be kind with macaws. Amazon birds do not threaten you.
Thus, it is possible to save the Amazon! Just jumping dangerous animals and teasing the destroyers. Bet your friends to save the Amazon and check your score in the ranking.
